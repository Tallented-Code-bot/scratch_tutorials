# Scratch Tutorials

## What is it?

Scratch tutorials is a website for tutorials about [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu).
I got the idea from [FlagClicked](https://github.com/FlagClicked/FlagClicked), but that
project is not in active development as of now.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tallented-Code-bot/scratch_tutorials/
cd scratch_tutorials
npm install
```

#### Running the frontend

```
npm run start
```

#### Running the backend

```
node server/index.js
```

#### Running everything

```
npm run build
node server/index.js
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/ to see it.
